# molrs-book
Extended documentation for molrs.

The goal of molrs is to write a cheminformatics toolkit that fulfills three ideals:
- The low-level cheminformatics code should be understandable (not the same as easy to understand!).
- The high-level API should be easy to learn and use.
- The functionality should enable small-molecule discovery and related tasks.
