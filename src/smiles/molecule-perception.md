# Molecule Perception
Molecule perception is the process of fleshing out the implicit properties of a molecule that aren't explicitly encoded in a SMILES. In particular, we need to:
1. resolve default bonds to single or delocalized.
2. find the rings in the molecule.
3. compute the number of implicit hydrogens.
